# Ari Hammond - Creative Technologist and MultiMedia Storyteller

Hi! I'm Ari Hammond, a Computational Media student at Georgia Tech. I plan to pursue my Master's in Digital Media and later a PhD in a similar field, with the eventual goal of teaching and researching emerging and/or interactive media technologies. I have experience in photography, web and app development, and design in Figma and Canva. This portfolio was developed with ReactJS and Vite, and deployed with DEPLOY_SFW
