# Ari Hammond - Creative Technologist and MultiMedia Storyteller

Hi! I'm Ari Hammond, a Computational Media student at Georgia Tech. I plan to pursue my Master's in Digital Media and later a PhD in a similar field, with the eventual goal of teaching and researching emerging and/or interactive media technologies. I have experience in photography, web and app development, and design in Figma and Canva. This portfolio was developed with ReactJS and Vite, and deployed with DEPLOY_SFW

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
