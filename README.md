# Welcome to my Portfolio

Hello! My name is Ari Hammond (they/them). I am a Computational Media student at Georgia Tech, with concentrations in People and Film & Media Studies. Through my academic and professional work I have developed skills in software development, UI/UX design, design research, and human-computer interaction that I apply to critical technical practice.

Under the supervision of Dr. André Brock, I am conducting practice-based research on Black feminist technopractice in interactive documentaries, ultimately culminating in my undergraduate thesis. My broader research experiences and interests include accessibility, public history/culutral heritage, and multimodal AI.
